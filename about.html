				<p>In general, fashion show clothing is not tailored to fit the model; rather, the model is selected to fit the clothing. Therefore, a modelâ€™s chance of being selected to model depends on his or her body and how the designer believes the fashion piece should fit. Backstage, models are dressed, and sometimes heavy makeup is applied for a dramatic appearance. Once they model an outfit, they return backstage to have it removed and, when modeling more than one outfit, are prepped to walk the catwalk again. The removal and application of makeup and complex outfits can take a while, so it is common for fashion shows to start late or run longer than expected.</p>

				    <p>Depending on the popularity of a fashion show, the audience might have paid a significant amount of money to be there. Front-row tickets are often very expensive and sometimes come with dinner afterward, transportation in luxury vehicles, and beverages during the show. Fashion editors tend to frequent popular shows and may carry a notebook to jot down notes about new trends. Likewise, photographers from fashion magazines might also be in the audience to capture photos for an upcoming edition.</p>

					<h3>What We Do</h3>
					<p>Mass-market fashion is dictated by trends and is renewed each season. The point of fashion shows is to get publicity and media coverage. Even within the more mainstream realms of fashion sense, there are many designers producing fashion that most of us would never consider wearing, much less be able to afford.</p>
